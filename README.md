A Bash script to create an image file of the SD Card in a Raspberry Pi for backup purposes. The script then uses [PiShrink](https://github.com/Drewsif/PiShrink) to compress the image file to save space.

## Setting it up

Download the script, made it executable, update and make sure the variables work for your Raspverry Pi per the comments in the script, and then run it.
